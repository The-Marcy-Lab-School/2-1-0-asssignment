> **TODO: @Instructor -** Fork this repo and update the canvas link for the assignment. Delete this sections before distributing.

## Before you start

Like in your last assignment, you'll be practicing the skills you have learned in a fun and engaging way! Again, you will not need to fork or clone this repo. Just follow the instructions.

Flexbox Froggy is an interactive game designed to teach/ help you practice the fundamentals of CSS Flexbox layout. Flexbox Froggy presents you with a series of levels, each representing a different layout challenge. The goal is to move the frogs to their corresponding lily pads by writing CSS code using Flexbox properties such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction.` This hands-on practice teaches you how to create flexible and responsive layouts using Flexbox!

## Instructions:

Go to [Flexbox Forggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and play and complete levels 1 through 20. Once you have completed level 20, take a screenshot/ picture and upload it to the [Canvas assignment](TODO: @Instructor - insert canvas assignment URL).

Happy Coding!
